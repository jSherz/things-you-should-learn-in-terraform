# Things you should learn in Terraform (Terraform koans)

This tutorial series guides you through a number of real-world scenarios that
you'll likely encounter as a builder using Terraform. These examples are
written for AWS, but could easily be adapted into a cloud provider of your
choice.

## Pre-requisites

It's recommended that you have a basic grasp of HCL, the language Terraform
projects use, before you get started.

Check out [Get Started - AWS in the Terraform docs] if you want a refresher
first.
